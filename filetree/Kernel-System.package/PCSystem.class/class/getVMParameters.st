getVMParameters
	"Answer an Array containing the current values of the VM's internal parameter and statistics registers. The same primitive can be called with one integer argument to read a specific parameter and with two parameters to set a writable parameter, although these variations may not be implemented. Optional."

	"VM parameters are numbered as follows:
		1	end of old-space (0-based, read-only)
		2	end of young-space (read-only)
		3	end of memory (read-only)
		4	allocationCount (read-only)
		5	allocations between GCs (read-write)
		6	survivor count tenuring threshold (read-write)
		7	full GCs since startup (read-only)
		8	total milliseconds in full GCs since startup (read-only)
		9	incremental GCs since startup (read-only)
		10	total milliseconds in incremental GCs since startup (read-only)
		11	tenures of surving objects since startup (read-only)
		12-20 specific to the translating VM (obsolete)
		21   root table size (read-only)
		22   root table overflows since startup (read-only)"
